        I have started reading the book and watching the lectures on YouTube. Most of the first section and lecture associated
         with the book is general computer language information that I already know, which makes sense, seeing as this was the 
         introductory computer science class at MIT for many years.  My takeaway so far is that it is important to know how to manage
          and measure complexity, and the book will teach several ways to manage complexity in computer programming. One of the ways 
          described by the professor is through abstraction, which makes sense seeing as most of the programs that I have written 
          currently have dealt with managing complexity through abstracting information into different functions and objects. One 
          thing mentioned in the introductory lecture that I find particularly interesting is implementing other languages inside 
          of the language, which Abelson calls Metalinguistic Abstraction, which he states is important for managing complexity as 
          sometimes you may need to implement a new language that fits your needs for a project.

        The second part of the lecture, and the first section of the book for that matter describes what to look for and learn when 
        learning a new programming language. Abelson states there are essentially three things to look for when learning a language,
         the primitive elements, the ways of combining primitives, and the ways you can abstract certain elements away in the program.
          In Lisp for example, primitives would be elements like numbers or strings, which is like many other languages. Another 
          example he brought up as primitives are the base operators built into the language like <em>+</em> or <em>-</em>. Combinations are when
           you combine primitives together with operators like the expression <em>(+ 2 3 4)</em> which would create the primitive 9. 
           Another important thing to know about Lisp is that it uses prefix or polish notation. This is different from many 
           other languages that I have used personally like Java or Python that use standard notation for operator functions. 
           The next thing introduced was abstractions. Abstractions can be variables or functions and are created with the 
           keyword define. You can declare a function with or without using a lambda expression. Conditionals are also introduced; 
           they are like ternary operators in other programming languages. The functions <em>if</em> and <em>cond</em> are used for conditionals and 
           are very similar.

        All of this leads into the first set of exercises, for the book section “The Elements of Programming”. My answers 
        can be found in the SICP repository on my GitHub.

        Its been two months and I've kinda been slacking on this. I'm going to continue doing the excersizes but I'm not going to
        make a blog post in the same way that I did last time because its really time consuming.
