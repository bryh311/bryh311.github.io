        <h3>Random Walk Visualizer</h3>
        <p>I've said earlier that I want to develop games using HTML5.
            judging by the sad state of this blog and website, I haven't
            in the past year and a half since I've started on this. Recently
            however, I have been dedicating more time to learning web development.
            Linked at the bottom of this page is my random walk visualizer. I made
            it to learn about javascript in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>The reason I chose to do a random walk visualization is because I think they're
            cool. I first heard of them from my Calculus professor as his main area of research
            is random walks, and I think they're neat as they have cool applications to a wide
            variety of fields include physics, biology, and computer science.
