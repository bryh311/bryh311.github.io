    <h2>SICP 5/27</h2>
    <p>
        I have decided to being reading Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programs. 
        It’s very popular as a meme in an internet forum that I occasionally browse, 
        and I know that it is a very popular book among hackers and computer scientists in general.
        I think that in reading it I will improve my understanding of how computer programs work and
        how to efficiently write clean code. I also feel that in reading it I will learn to write functional code. 
        I’ve been interested in the functional paradigm for quite some time, but I've never been able to dive in 
        learn about it. I’m hoping that by keeping a blog of reading through the book I’ll be able to stay on track 
        and motivate myself to read it. I’m going to put my answers to the book’s assignments in a repo on my GitHub 
        and I’ll use Racket and Scheme to complete the assignments.
