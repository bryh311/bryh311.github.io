        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            This is my site. It is the first website that I have
            designed. I know very little about html and css. Hopefully this
            site serves as some sort of oddity for whoever is reading it
            I hope that you find it as amusing as I do. It's certainly 
            better to have a site than to not have a site. It's like 
            social media but way cooler because I can control exactly how
            everything on the site looks. I don't have anything implemented with 
            Javascript yet. Maybe I'll add some scripts later.
