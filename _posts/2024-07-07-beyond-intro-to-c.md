# Background
Back in fall 2023, I was a TA for a C programming class (CS 240) at Purdue University. 
It was an alright class. It covered enough C to get you comfortable in a C codebase,
but not enough to be dangerous. In this blog, I intend to create a CS 240 part 2,
focused on C++. I only assume two prerequisites: basic knowledge of C and basic
knowledge of some kind of object oriented language (e.g. Java).
