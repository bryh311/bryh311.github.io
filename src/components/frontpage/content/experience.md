## Experience
### Software Developer Internship -- Epic Systems
I did mainly frontend develoment with Typescript and React in this role. I designed and developed a new workflow in the 
Cost Calculator application of MyChart, making it easier for insurance members to determine the cost of a procedure. 
This role involved doing research to determine what people expect in insurance estimatation software, followed by a 
focus group to ensure that the developed design was easy to use and to gain future direction on the project, and ending
with development of the workflow.

### Process Controls Engineering Internship -- Cleveland Cliffs
In this role I did a combination of OT security work and software development. I developed several new features for a
system tracking application used throughout a steel mill that tracked 4,000 entities, including a feature to determine
what subnets a given system was connected to, patch / operating system version information for each of the systems, and
an email alert system to determine when active directory permissions had been changed. I worked with .NET and built associated
Grafana dashboards. Aside from software development, I piloted an implementation of Verve OT Security software to track
PLCs and RTUs throughout our industrial network. This was a successful implementation, and after my internship Verve software
was implemented in other Cleveland Cliffs steel mills.
