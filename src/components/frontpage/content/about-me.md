# Bryce Hill

I was an software developer intern at [Epic](https://www.epic.com) this summer, working on the Cost Calculator 
application in [MyChart](https://www.mychart.org). 

I recently graduated from Purdue University with a BS in Computer Science, concentrated in systems programming.
I'm interested in cloud and infrastructure, and I am currently working towards getting certifications.

Outside of work I enjoy nature, listening/making music, lifting heavy objects,
and reading.
