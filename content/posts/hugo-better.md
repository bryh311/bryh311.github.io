Initially this site was written in plain HTML.

That sucked.

Sure, it was fun making my own css style and learning HTML, but I could never
motivate myself to write anything. There was too much boilerplate.

Then I tried Jekyll. Jekyll is alright, its just old. None of the themes for Jekyll
look like they hadn't been updated in decade. Which is fine, I like the web design of
that era, but not many other people do. Jekyll also seemed like an annoying SSG to
use for a non power user (skill issue). 

After that I tried Astro, but gave up because `npm` is broken on my machine. I'll fix
it later.

Finally I got to Hugo, where I am now. Hugo is great. It seems to be more popular now
compared to Jekyll, its written in go, which is a nice language, and its easy to be
productive in. I don't have to be a power user in order to set up a blog.
