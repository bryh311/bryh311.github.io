Hi, I'm Bryce, a computer science student at Purdue Univeristy.
I'm interested in several areas of computer science, like programming languages,
databases, and software engineering. 


I'm was employed this summer as a process control intern at Cleveland-Cliffs working in the .NET
and windows ecosystems, and I used to be a teaching assistant for both a C programming
and discrete mathematics.


In my free time, I program, watch football, and play guitar.


I plan on using this page to make blog posts about different computer science and software
engineering topics, mostly to practice my writing abilities. Stay tuned for when I release 
posts.
