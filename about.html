            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm a student at Purdue University studying Computer Science. I'm interested
                in systems programming, web development, and artificial intelligence.
                My favorite programming languages are C and JavaScript, and I have
                experience with Java, Python, and Ruby as well. I plan on attending
                grad school for computer science and becoming a computer science professor.
                I took the vacation photos on the front page.
